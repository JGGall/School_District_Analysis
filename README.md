# School District Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis

### This analysis was always meant to allow the school board and other stakeholders to see tables of data that would allow them to make comparisons among the schools based on nschool performance (based on testing), school size, spending per student, and type of school (district school or charter school). The analysis had to be adjusted after the math and reading scored of all of the ninth-graders at a medium-sized high school were set aside due to academic dishonesty. It became a special point of interest to see how this adjustment impacted the overall analysis.
